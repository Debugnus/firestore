# Firestore (for Ubiquity Unifi Security Gateway)
This is basically a learning project for me to try a challenge.  The idea is for a user to give it IP addresses from Wireshark to spit out these IP addresses copied and pasted from Wireshark for entering into the a IP group list in the 'config.boot' file of the USG.  Hoping it's a working idea, however, not that bothered at this stage. - Purely an idea.
