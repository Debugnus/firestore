# Firestore (for Unbiquity Unifi Security Gateway)
This is a learning project to try a challenge.  The idea is to store and spit out IP addresses for entering into the a IP group list in the 'config.boot' file of the USG.  Hoping it's a working idea, however, not that bothered at this stage. - Purely an idea.
