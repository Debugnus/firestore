# Firestore (for Ubiquity Unifi Security Gateway)
This is basically a learning project for me to try a challenge.  The idea is for a user to give it IP addresses from Wireshark to spit out these IP addresses copied and pasted from Wireshark for entering into an Address Group list under the Firewall settings in the UniFi Controller.  The output format makes for easier copy and paste when there are multipule addresses sparated by commas.
